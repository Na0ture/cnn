## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

+ `fastai`: fastai bakes in SOTA deep learning techniques to facilitate experiments
+ `pyts`: pyts contains useful time series manipulation methods, in particular imaging techniques
+ `quandl`: quandl provides free, quality historical stock price data.

### Installing

```
pip install pyts
pip install quandl
```
for `fastai` it is easier to use https://course.fast.ai/start_colab.html
